### General:

 - Added attr_reader for attributes in the Credit and Debit objects.

 - Added a 'to_string' function for the Credit and Debit objects. These functions return a comma-delimited string of the variables in that object.

 - Credit and Debit parsing use the same function with different parameters.

 - - Changes have begun, but will not be in affect.


### Credit Statements:

 - Credit statement parsing is now possible. With a few tweaks from 0.0.2.


### Debit Statements:

 - Fixed parsing problem for Debit transactions resulting in wrong 'Amount'.
